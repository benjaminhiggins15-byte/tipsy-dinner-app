# Tipsy Dinner — FEATURE_SPECS.md

Deep per-feature technical reference. Split out of CLAUDE.md (July 2026) to keep
that file under Claude Code's performance threshold.

Read the section for the feature you are touching. CLAUDE.md holds the
always-relevant material (design system, data layer, AI layer, architecture,
session rules) plus a Load-Bearing Contracts index that points here.

Pointer discipline: every contract is summarized once in CLAUDE.md's contracts
index and stated in full exactly once — here. Do not duplicate full detail
across both files.

## Recipe Photos

Live in production. Each recipe carries a single user-uploaded hero image.
Schema: `recipes.photo_url` (text, nullable — pre-existing column, previously unused)
and `recipes.photo_version` (int4, not null, default 0, added for this feature).

**Storage path conventions (`recipe-photos` bucket) — load-bearing:**
- Live recipe photo: `{userId}/{recipeId}.jpg` — overwritten in place on replace
  (`upsert: true`).
- Frozen share copy: `{userId}/share-{token}.jpg` — an immutable byte-copy made at
  share time, one per share. See "Recipe Sharing" in FEATURE_SPECS.md for how it's produced.

**BINDING INVARIANT: the share copy's immutability rests entirely on path
separation.** `uploadRecipePhoto` and `removeRecipePhoto` may ONLY ever construct
`{userId}/{recipeId}.jpg` (bare UUID filename); `deleteSavedRecipe` touches no
storage at all. No mutating function may ever construct a `share-`-prefixed
filename. Violating this breaks the guarantee that a shared recipe's photo never
changes or disappears.

**`photo_version` exists solely for cache-busting** and is appended to displayed
image `src`s as `?v={photo_version}`. It is incremented on every upload and every
remove, from a freshly-read DB value (not a client-held one, to avoid racing a
concurrent tab). **Never replace this with a render-time value like `Date.now()`**
— that would change the URL on every render, defeat browser caching, and burn
egress for no benefit.

**Public bucket ≠ SDK access permitted (general Supabase Storage truth, not just
photos).** A bucket's "public" flag only affects anonymous `GET` requests to the
`/object/public/...` CDN URL, which bypass RLS entirely. It does **not** exempt the
storage SDK's `.download()` / `.upload()` / `.remove()` / `.list()` calls, which
always enforce `storage.objects` RLS regardless of the bucket's public flag. Proving
a public URL loads anonymously does not prove an authenticated SDK call will
succeed. The `recipe-photos` bucket's write policies are owner-scoped (the object
path must start with the caller's own user-id folder) — this is why the share copy
lives at `{userId}/share-{token}.jpg` rather than a bucket-root `shares/` prefix; a
top-level prefix silently violates the INSERT policy and fails with no visible
error unless the caller checks for one.

**Crop step precedes compression.** Every photo upload — first upload AND
replace — routes through a full-screen crop step before compression/upload; this is
unconditional, not a picker-time option. Flow: `handlePhotoFileInputChange` holds
the chosen `File` and opens `PhotoCropOverlay` → user repositions/zooms → Confirm
calls `handlePhotoSelected(file, cropRect)` → `uploadRecipePhoto` →
`compressImageFile(file, cropRect)`. Cancel discards everything and leaves the
recipe completely unchanged. The crop is baked in — applied client-side inside the
existing single-pass canvas draw in `compressImageFile`; no originals are retained,
no crop coordinates are persisted, no schema change. Re-cropping means
re-uploading (replace already supports this). `PhotoCropOverlay` renders a fixed
4:3 frame at the same corner radius the hero renders at (see below) — the frame IS
the preview: what the user confirms is exactly what renders on the card and the
share. Because the stored image is already 4:3, `object-fit: cover` on the render
surfaces is effectively a no-op. Zoom is a slider, not pinch. Pan/zoom clamping
guarantees the frame is never under-covered: minimum zoom is the "image fully
covers frame" floor (`max(frameW/naturalW, frameH/naturalH)`), and pan bounds are
re-clamped on every pan AND zoom change. Pinch could be added later without
touching the pan/zoom → `cropRect` plumbing.

**`CropRect` is fractional, not absolute pixels.** `{ fx, fy, fWidth, fHeight }` are
fractions (0–1) of the image they're applied to, not absolute source pixels. This is
load-bearing: the crop overlay computes the fraction against a downscaled preview,
while `compressImageFile` applies it against the original full-resolution bitmap.
Because each axis's fraction is multiplied by that same axis's real dimension, the
mapping is correct at any resolution and requires no scale factor. **Do not convert
`CropRect` back to absolute pixel coordinates** — that would reintroduce a
preview-vs-original dependency. Only three files touch it: `image.ts`
(defines/consumes), `App.tsx` (produces), `data.ts` (opaque passthrough).

**Crop preview decodes a downscaled bitmap, not the raw file.** The crop overlay's
`<img>` does not point at the raw `File` object-URL — it decodes a resized preview
via `createImageBitmap(file, { resizeWidth: CROP_PREVIEW_MAX_EDGE })` (1200,
matching `image.ts`'s `MAX_EDGE`) and displays that instead. Pointing the `<img>` at
a raw multi-megapixel file caused a ~4.9 second decode before the crop screen
appeared; the downscaled decode cut this to ~168ms (measured on-device, same
3.41MB file). `compressImageFile` at Confirm still decodes the original at full
resolution, so crop fidelity and output quality are unaffected. Do not "simplify"
the preview back to the raw file — the decode cost is the reason this exists.

**Gotcha: Tailwind Preflight clamps `<img>` width.** Tailwind v4's Preflight
(pulled in via `@import "tailwindcss"` in `src/styles.css`) includes a global
`img, video { max-width: 100%; height: auto; }`. Per the CSS spec, `max-width`
clamps the used width regardless of an inline `width` declaration — inline styles
only win property-vs-property, they cannot unset a stylesheet's `max-width`. Every
other `<img>` in the app is sized `width: 100%` inside a fixed container and never
requests more than its box, so this rule had never had anything to clip. The crop
preview is the first image in the app that intentionally renders wider than its
container (that's what zooming in means), and the cap silently limited its rendered
width while the JS offset math positioned it as though uncapped — producing a
growing gap on the right as zoom increased. Fixed with `maxWidth: "none"` inline on
that element only. Note the asymmetry: Preflight has no `max-height` rule, so the
bug was width-only — which is what identified it. Any future UI that needs an
element to exceed its container (pan/zoom viewers, feed image work) must account
for this.

**Client-side compression (`src/tipsy/image.ts`).** `compressImageFile()` caps the
longest edge at 1200px (never upscales smaller images), re-encodes as JPEG at 0.8
quality, single-pass with no iterative size targeting. Uses the native
`createImageBitmap` — no external compression dependency. Takes an optional
`cropRect` (see above), applied in the same single-pass canvas draw as the resize.
Throws a typed `UnsupportedImageError` when the browser can't decode the file,
naming HEIC specifically when the failure looks HEIC-shaped (by MIME type or
`.heic`/`.heif` extension).

**Hero corner radius is 30** (was 16) in exactly two places: the RecipeCard hero
and the public share route (`r.$token.tsx`). The recipe-list row thumbnail remains
`borderRadius: 10` — a deliberately distinct, icon-sized treatment, intentionally
out of scope. There is no shared radius constant; all three are independent inline
values.

**RecipeCard header row is share / edit / camera / cart** (in that order; cart only
when the recipe has ingredients). The trash icon was removed from this row — delete
is reachable only via card → Edit (pencil) → "Delete recipe" → confirm, inside
`AddYourOwn.tsx`. `RecipeCard`'s own `confirmDelete` state and modal were removed as
dead code, and `App.tsx` no longer imports `deleteSavedRecipe`; `deleteSavedRecipe`
itself is unchanged in `data.ts`, with its one remaining caller in
`AddYourOwn.tsx`. The camera control is context-aware: no photo → tapping it opens
the file picker directly; photo present → tapping it opens a small dropdown
(Replace / Remove), with Remove behind a confirm. Either path (direct pick or
Replace) opens the crop overlay next, before anything uploads — see "Crop step
precedes compression" above.

## Recipe Sharing

Live in production. Shared recipe links are frozen snapshots — captured at share
time, unaffected by later edits or deletion of the live recipe — following the
`grocery_list_shares` model (see Grocery List in FEATURE_SPECS.md) rather than the old live-pointer
model. Rationale: shared artifacts are gifts, not growth mechanics; a gift that can
be silently swapped or retracted isn't a gift.

**`recipe_shares`** (dashboard-only, no in-repo migration, per existing convention):
`id`, `user_id`, `share_token` (unique), `recipe` (JSONB snapshot), `created_at`. RLS:
owner select/insert + a permissive anon select — mirrors `grocery_list_shares`
exactly.

**Key functions (`src/tipsy/data.ts`):** `shareRecipeSnapshot(recipeId)` reads the
live recipe + ingredients, runs every step through `normalizeStep()` **at capture
time** (so the frozen blob always holds `{title, instruction}` objects, never a mix
of legacy plain-string and object steps), mints a fresh `crypto.randomUUID()` token
per call — no reuse, unlike the legacy `shareRecipe` — and writes one `recipe_shares`
row. `getRecipeSnapshotByToken(token)` is the anon read for the public route, gated
entirely by RLS (no `user_id` filter).

**Snapshot shape:** `title`, `description`, `ingredients: {name, qty}[]`,
`steps: {title, instruction}[]` (normalized), `cookTime`, `serves`,
`photoUrl: string | null`. No cook history / `cook_events` — deliberate; cook data is
owner-only and was never shown on the public route, and stays that way.

**Photo is a byte-copy, not a URL reference (Recipe Photos build).**
`shareRecipeSnapshot` mints the token first, then — only if the recipe has a photo —
downloads the live photo bytes via the storage SDK and re-uploads them to
`{userId}/share-{token}.jpg` (see "Recipe Photos" in FEATURE_SPECS.md for why this path shape,
not a bucket-root prefix), storing that path's public URL as `photoUrl` in the
snapshot. Each share gets its own independent copy — sharing the same recipe twice
produces two separate photo files, not two references to one. This is what makes
the guarantee hold: the owner can later delete the recipe, remove the photo, or
replace it with a different one, and every previously-shared link keeps showing the
exact photo that existed at the moment it was shared. The public route
(`r.$token.tsx`) renders the hero photo before the title, gated on
`photoUrl && !photoFailed`, with an `onError` handler that sets `photoFailed` and
collapses the hero block entirely — no broken-image icon — on load failure. The
legacy live-share path (`shareRecipe` / `getPublicRecipeByToken`) does not carry
photos and was deliberately left untouched.

**Two token namespaces, one resolution order.** `shareRecipeSnapshot` never reads or
reuses a `recipes.share_token` — it only ever mints a fresh UUID into `recipe_shares`.
This means a given token can only ever resolve in one table in practice (independent
UUID v4 draws), which is what makes the public route's try-snapshot-then-fall-back
ordering (see Architecture / SSR in CLAUDE.md) safe: it can't accidentally serve the wrong table's
row for a given token.

**Migration path is a fallback, not a backfill.** No existing share links were
migrated into `recipe_shares`. `RecipeCard`'s share button (`handleShare`) now calls
`shareRecipeSnapshot` instead of the legacy `shareRecipe`, so every *new* share from
this point on is a frozen snapshot. Pre-existing tokens (e.g. founder/wife/brother
links minted before this change) keep resolving via the untouched legacy
`shareRecipe`/`getPublicRecipeByToken` path — those live-pointer links still mutate
if the underlying recipe is edited or deleted; only shares minted after this change
are frozen. There is no plan to backfill old tokens into snapshots.

## Grocery List

Live in production (three phases: surface + data + dumb combining; AI enrichment;
snapshot sharing). No 5th nav tab — entry is a cart icon on the Recipes/Categories
header plus an "add to grocery list" button on RecipeCard. All schema hand-applied
via the Supabase dashboard (no migration files).

**`grocery_items`** (owner-only RLS on all ops): base cols `id`, `user_id`,
`display_name`, `quantity` (free-text), `checked`, `source_recipe_id` (provenance
only, never re-read live), `sort_order`; enrichment cols `normalized_name`, `amount`,
`unit`, `aisle` (produce/dairy/meat/pantry/frozen/other), `enrichment_status`
(pending | enriched | raw | failed). **Raw `display_name`/`quantity` are never
overwritten** by enrichment — normalized fields are added in parallel, so there is
always a safe raw fallback to render.

**`grocery_list_shares`**: `user_id`, `share_token` (a fresh `crypto.randomUUID()`
minted on *every* share — unlike `shareRecipe`, which reuses one token per recipe),
`items` (JSONB snapshot). RLS: owner select/insert + a permissive anon select (`using
(true)`); the unguessable token is the real access boundary. No revoke path (deleting
the row is the only invalidation) — accepted, parity with recipe sharing.

**Key functions (`src/tipsy/data.ts`, GROCERY LIST section):** `loadGroceryItems`,
`addGroceryItems` (bulk insert, `sort_order` from current max, status pending),
`addManualGroceryItem`, `toggleGroceryItemChecked`, `clearGroceryItems('all' |
'checked')`, `enrichGroceryItems` (isolated AI island — see AI Layer in CLAUDE.md),
`groupGroceryItems`, `shareGroceryList` (reads live items, never writes; mints a fresh
snapshot row — later edits/clears don't affect an existing snapshot),
`getPublicGroceryListByToken` (anon read for the public route).

**`groupGroceryItems`** lives in `data.ts` (not App.tsx) so the public route can
import it without pulling the client bundle into SSR — pure function of
`GroceryItem[]`, buckets by aisle then name, combines additively only when both rows
are enriched and share a unit, else falls back to exact-string quantity match.

**Hold-until-ready UX**: new items are held out of the rendered list (generic
"Updating…" indicator) up to `GROCERY_ENRICHMENT_HOLD_MS` (18000ms) while enrichment
resolves, so text/grouping doesn't visibly jump. `shareGroceryList` polls for pending
enrichment up to the same ~18s cap before minting, then falls back to whatever's there
— a share must never block forever.

**Public route**: `src/routes/list.$token.tsx`, modeled on `r.$token.tsx` (same
not-found styling, footer, no-login structure). Any login wall on a Vercel *preview*
link is Vercel's deployment-protection SSO gate, unrelated to the app; production has
no such gate.

## Cook History

Live in production. Lets a user log real cook attempts (date, optional score, optional
note) against a saved recipe and see them in a third HISTORY tab on the Recipe Card.

**`cook_events`** (owner-only RLS, four separate per-op policies — matches the
`grocery_items` convention; schema is dashboard-only, no in-repo migration, per
existing convention): `id uuid` PK, `user_id uuid` FK→`auth.users` (on delete
cascade), `recipe_id uuid` FK→`recipes` (on delete cascade — intentional: cook history
is deleted along with its recipe), `cooked_on date`, `score numeric(3,1)` nullable,
`note text` nullable, `created_at timestamptz`.

**Key functions (`src/tipsy/data.ts`, COOK HISTORY section):**
`loadCookEventsForRecipe`, `addCookEvent`, `updateCookEvent`, `deleteCookEvent`, plus
two pure helpers: `headlineRatingFromEvents` (score of the most-recent scored cook, or
null; ties broken by `created_at`) and `todayLocalDateString` (local-date, not UTC —
same convention as `chips.ts`).

Cook events ride along on the existing bulk category load — added as a nested
relation in `getSavedRecipesForCategory` alongside `ingredients`; no per-recipe fetch
exists or was introduced. `Recipe` gained optional `cookEvents?: CookEvent[]` and
derived `headlineRating?: number | null`.

**Live-refresh pattern (load-bearing).** The "Log cook" write UI is self-contained in
`RecipeCard`. There is no other "write-and-stay-on-card" refresh pattern in the
codebase — this one is new. `RecipeCard` holds local `cookEvents` state, seeded once
from `recipe.cookEvents`; after any add/edit/delete it updates that local state, and
both the HISTORY tab and the headline rating read from local state (headline
recomputed via `headlineRatingFromEvents`), NOT from the `recipe` prop — otherwise the
card shows stale data until re-navigation. `clearRecipeCache?.(categoryKey)` is also
called after each write so the category list re-fetches truth on next visit. Any
future change to the HISTORY tab or headline must preserve this local-state read, or
live updates regress.

**UI.** Third tab, HISTORY, is hardcoded (matching the existing Ingredients/Steps
copy-paste style, not data-driven). "Log cook" button lives at the top of the HISTORY
tab (not the header). Logging portal is a light `#FAF7F2` bottom sheet: editable date
(pre-filled today), a net-new on-screen decimal keypad for score (0–9, `.`, backspace;
one decimal; clamped 1.0–10.0; empty = no score), optional note; single Save. Tapping
a cook row's pencil icon opens the same portal in edit mode (the row tap itself is
reserved for the existing note-expand/collapse behavior); delete lives inside the edit
portal and reuses the existing delete-confirm modal. Headline shows as "RATING 7.5"
under the description (label styled like the category label; number 13px/weight 500,
one decimal via `.toFixed(1)`); renders nothing when no scored cook exists.

---

## Recipe Step Titles

Live in production (merged to main 2026-07-13, commit `4e5a394`). Steps carry an
optional per-step title, rendered as collapsible rows on the Recipe Card.

**`RecipeStep` is `string | { title: string; instruction: string }` (data.ts).**
Legacy plain-string steps and new object steps both exist in the database and are
both valid — string support must never be removed.

**`normalizeStep()` (data.ts) is a load-bearing contract.** Takes a `RecipeStep`,
returns `{ title, instruction }`, coercing a plain string to `{ title: '',
instruction: step }`. Every step reader MUST route through it — a new reader that
skips it will render `[object Object]`. Five readers exist today, all compliant:
Recipe Card STEPS tab (App.tsx — collapsible accordion rows); `ExpandedRecipeOverlay`
(App.tsx — the Recipe Preview sheet from the Build mini-player, flat, title
prepended); `AddYourOwn.tsx` and its `PreviewCard` (Write Your Own editor); `src/routes/r.$token.tsx` (public shared route — flat, title prepended, deliberately
not collapsible); `recipeToXML` (App.tsx — serializes steps for the AI).

**Two surfaces diverge deliberately.** In-app STEPS tab: collapsible, collapsed by
default, with a Fraunces-italic hint line ("Tap each step for details") shown only
when ≥1 step has a title. Public shared route and `ExpandedRecipeOverlay`: always
expanded, title prepended, nothing to tap — do not add collapsing there. Expanded
step bodies use Inter, not Fraunces italic (Fraunces is reserved for
personal/journal content like cook notes; step instructions are body copy).

**AI step XML contract.** Steps are emitted as `<step title="Short
title">Full instruction</step>`; the `title` attribute is omitted entirely when a
step has no title (not `title=""`). Title escapes `&` → `&amp;` then `"` →
`&quot;`, in that order; the parser reverses both (`&quot;` → `"` then `&amp;` →
`&`). Parser regex: `/<step(?:\s+title="([^"]*)")?>(.*?)<\/step>/g` — matches both
titled and untitled steps, always producing `{ title, instruction }` (title `''`
when absent). This step-parsing regex lives inside `parseRecipeFromAIResponse` (see
AI Layer in CLAUDE.md) — the single consolidated recipe-parse function used by all three former
per-call-site parse blocks.

**Step-title backfill.** `backfillStepTitles()` (data.ts) is a one-time, idempotent
backfill that titles existing plain-string steps via an isolated JSON-in/JSON-out
call to the `ai-chat` edge function (own prompt, `STEP_TITLE_BACKFILL_SYSTEM_PROMPT`
— modeled on `enrichGroceryItems`, never merged with the conversational prompt).
Sends only `{index, instruction}` / receives `{index, title}` — instructions are
preserved verbatim, never regenerated. Writes via `updateSavedRecipe(id, { steps
})` (steps-only patch; the ingredient code path is untouched). The function stays
in the codebase permanently but is deliberately unwired — no UI, no persistent
hook. Run pattern: temporarily attach to `window`, run once from the browser
console while logged into the target account, then remove the hook. Used twice so
far (production, and a preview test account).

**`AddYourOwn.tsx` step-write paths must write objects, never strings.** `addStep`
and `confirmEditStep` both previously wrote plain strings unconditionally, silently
discarding any existing title — a live data-loss bug, now fixed. `startEditStep`
seeds the title into edit state so it round-trips through an edit. Any future
step-write path must preserve the `{ title, instruction }` shape.

## Build Home-Screen Suggestion Chips

Home-screen chips are data + a deterministic picker, not hardcoded JSX. Defined in
`src/tipsy/chips.ts`, rendered via `.map()` in App.tsx. `pickChips(new Date())`
returns exactly 3 (active time-aware chips fill first, rest from an evergreen pool,
varied by type), picked once per mount via `useMemo` — stable within a session,
varied across. Chips route through the unchanged `handleChipClick` (functionally
identical to a typed message).

Each chip: `header`, `body`, `prompt` (fired text), `type` (build/brainstorm/help),
optional `timing`. Five timing shapes: `seasonal`, `fixedHoliday`, `floatingHoliday`,
`recurringWeekly` (supports a season wrapping the New Year, e.g. football Sep–Feb),
`oneOff`. `isChipActive(chip, today)` resolves liveness. At least one time-aware chip
is present every session (seasons act as an always-on baseline).

**Adding chips is data-only** — add to `evergreenChips` / `timeAwareChips`; no need to
touch `isChipActive`, `pickChips`, or any logic. Schema was designed for the full
future cultural calendar, so expanding it is data-entry, not engineering.

**CRITICAL date convention: LOCAL-midnight throughout `chips.ts`.** Production calls
`pickChips(new Date())` (local), and users think in local days. **Never use `new
Date("YYYY-MM-DD")`** — it parses as UTC midnight and shifts windows a day west of UTC
(this was a real bug: July 4th opened/closed a day late). Use the local-parse helpers
`parseLocalDate`, `parseMonthDayWithYear`, `toLocalStartOfDay`. Do not reintroduce
UTC string-parsing.

**Standing test: `src/tipsy/chips.test.ts`** (`bun run src/tipsy/chips.test.ts`) — 29
cases across all timing shapes at their tight window edges; imports the real chip
defs. Re-run whenever timing logic or calendar entries change.
